# endpoints [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/endpoints/endpoints.png)](http://travis-ci.org/endpoints/endpoints)
> yet another rest api framework

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/endpoints.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/endpoints/)

# What is it?
This repository is a work in progress. The example folder contains the current structure for what will eventually become a convention-over-configuration based approach to developing [json-api](http://jsonapi.org) compliant apis in javascript.

Endpoints currently uses a Knex/Bookshelf/Express stack, but it is built with modularity in mind. Subbing in another data layer, or http server should be trivial.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone repo
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`
4. Open browser to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
