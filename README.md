# endpoints [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/endpoints/endpoints.png)](http://travis-ci.org/endpoints/endpoints)
> A json-api compliant api framework for javascript.

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/endpoints.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/endpoints/)

# What is it?
See the the [READMEs in each module folder](/endpoints/endpoints/tree/master/modules), or the [example implemtation](https://github.com/endpoints/example) for more.

*__Note:__ Each library in the modules directory will eventually be a stand-alone package that can be used in isolation. This project will eventually consume those packages in an opinionated fashion, providing a convention-based framework for developing APIs in javascript.*
