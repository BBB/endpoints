# Up and Running

One can get up and running with endpoints in several ways.

#### Using npm

The primary way to use endpoints is to install it as an npm
package.

`npm install endpoints`

endpoints uses semantic versioning. Major breaking API changes
will only happen on major version releases.

#### Using the github repository

Because endpoints is in active, not-yet-major-versioned
development, one may be interested in using endpoints from
the github repository.

To do this, add this line to the dependencies in your `package.json`:

`"endpoints": "git://github.com/endpoints/endpoints.git"`
